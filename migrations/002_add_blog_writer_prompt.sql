Blog Post Outline & Instructions:
{{BLOG_OUTLINE}}

Writing Task:
Expand the provided outline into a full blog post of approximately {{ESTIMATED_WORD_COUNT}} words.

Key Instructions (Follow Strictly):
1.  **Adherence to Outline**: Each section of your blog post MUST correspond to a section in the outline. Use the ''title'' from the outline section as your H2 heading. Expand on every ''point'' listed under each section. Incorporate ''keyTakeaways'' naturally.
2.  **Persona and Tone**: Maintain the specified ''persona'' ("{{WRITER_PERSONA}}") and ''tone'' ("{{TONE}}") throughout the article.
3.  **Target Audience**: Write for the ''targetAudience'' ("{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}"). Adjust complexity and examples accordingly.
4.  **Technical Depth**: Ensure the content matches the ''technicalDepth'' ("{{TECHNICAL_DEPTH}}"). 
    - For ''beginner'': Explain jargon, use analogies, keep it simple.
    - For ''intermediate'': Assume some foundational knowledge, explain moderately complex topics.
    - For ''expert'': Use precise terminology, delve into complex details, assume high prior knowledge.
5.  **Content Quality**:
    - Provide accurate, up-to-date information. If a specific data point is needed but not provided, use a placeholder like "[Insert specific data for X]" or research it if feasible and you are confident.
    - Make the content engaging, well-structured, and easy to read. Use smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections.
6.  **SEO Integration**:
    - Naturally weave the ''primaryKeyword'' ("{{PRIMARY_KEYWORD}}") into the text, especially in the introduction, conclusion, and some headings if appropriate.
    - Subtly incorporate ''secondaryKeywords'' ({{SECONDARY_KEYWORDS}}) where relevant.
    - The overall content should strongly support the provided ''metaDescription'': "{{META_DESCRIPTION}}".
7.  **Markdown Formatting**:
    - Use H1 for the main blog title.
    - Use H2 for section titles from the outline. Use H3 or H4 for sub-headings if necessary for clarity within a section.
    - Use standard markdown for lists (bullet/numbered), bold, italics, blockquotes, etc.
    - For chemical formulas or CAS numbers, use inline code (`text`).
    - If tables are appropriate for data, use markdown table syntax.
8.  **Linking**:
    - If internal links are provided, integrate them naturally into the text. For example: "For more details on [linked text], see our [page]({{INTERNAL_LINKS}})."
    - Similarly for external links: "According to [Authoritative Source]({{EXTERNAL_LINKS}}), this process..."
9.  **Call to Action**: End the blog post with the specified CTA: "{{CTA_TEXT}}". If a link is given, format it as a markdown link: "[{{CTA_TEXT}}]({{CTA_LINK}})".
10. **Word Count**: Strive to meet the estimated word count for each section and the total.
11. **Review and Refine**: Before concluding, mentally review your generated post. Does it fulfill all aspects of the outline? Is it coherent, accurate, and engaging for the target audience? Make one pass of improvements.

Output only the complete blog post in Markdown format. Do not include any pre-amble, post-amble, or conversational text outside the Markdown document.
